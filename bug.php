This code suffers from a potential issue related to how PHP handles type juggling and comparison.  In the `if` condition,  `$user_input` (which is likely coming from user input and could be a string) is directly compared to 0. PHP's loose comparison (`==`) will consider many values equivalent to 0, leading to unexpected behavior.  For example, an empty string '', '0',  '0.0', and even 'false' would all evaluate to true in the condition. 

```php
$user_input = ""; // or '0', '0.0', 'false', etc.
if ($user_input == 0) {
  echo "User input is zero";
}
```
