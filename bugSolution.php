The solution involves using strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`). Strict comparison checks for both value and type equality.  This prevents unexpected matches with values that are numerically equivalent to zero but are not of numeric type. 

```php
$user_input = ""; // or '0', '0.0', 'false', etc.
if ($user_input === 0) {
  echo "User input is zero";
} else {
  echo "User input is not zero";
}
```

Alternatively, you can explicitly type-cast the user input to an integer before comparing:

```php
$user_input = (int)""; // or '0', '0.0', 'false', etc.
if ($user_input == 0) {
  echo "User input is zero";
} else {
  echo "User input is not zero";
}
```
However, strict comparison (`===`) is generally preferred for clarity and to avoid potential unexpected behavior.
